### Description
This assignment is a continuation of the Earbuds Promotional Page. Each student must complete this assignment individually.

It's time to put everything together! You will use all the concepts covered so far—SASS, AJAX, the template element, and the Fetch API—to make the Earbuds Model Page dynamic. An API link will be provided, outputting information about the earbuds in JSON format. You will use the Fetch API to retrieve this data on page load and update the view as the user interacts with the hotspots.

### Requirements
1. Use the HTML Template element to display materials, as covered in class.
2. Your Fetch functions should handle the stages of an AJAX request gracefully, including separate functions/handlers for each stage of the request.
3. Implement a loading icon to indicate content is loading.
4. If the AJAX request is successful, build out your view using the response data (the application state).
